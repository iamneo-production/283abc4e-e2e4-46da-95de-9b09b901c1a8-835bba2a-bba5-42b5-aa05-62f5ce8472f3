      <h1>About ICC</h1>
      <p>
        Formation: The ICC was founded on June 15, 1909, as the Imperial Cricket Conference, and it was renamed the International Cricket Council in 1989.
        Headquarters: The ICC's headquarters is located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
        Members: The ICC has a membership structure consisting of Full Members, Associate Members, and Affiliate Members. As of my last update, there were 12 Full Members who played Test cricket, and a larger number of Associate and Affiliate Members.
        Leadership: The ICC is governed by a Board, which includes representatives from its member nations. The Chairman of the ICC is one of the key figures in international cricket administration.
        Tournaments: The ICC organizes several major cricket tournaments, including the ICC Cricket World Cup (both for men and women), ICC T20 World Cup, and the ICC Champions Trophy (which was discontinued after 2017). Additionally, it manages the ICC Test Championship to promote Test cricket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rules and Regulations: The ICC is responsible for setting the rules and regulations of the game, including the playing conditions for international matches.
        Development: The ICC also focuses on the development of cricket in non-traditional cricket-playing nations and has various programs to promote the sport globally.
        Please note that the ICC's activities and leadership may have evolved since my last update in September 2021. I recommend visiting the official ICC website or checking the latest news sources for the most current information about the organization.
